# basic-counter
Counter12 is a web application that allows users to interact with a smart contract deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain network. The project consists of a Solidity smart contract called "Counter12," a frontend website, and JavaScript code to facilitate communication with the contract.

Features:

    Increment Count: Users can increase the count stored in the smart contract by paying 0.01 Matic (or the equivalent token on other EVM-compatible chains) for each increment. The website provides an input field where users can specify the number of increments they want to perform.

    Fund Withdrawal: The contract owner can withdraw the funds accumulated from user payments for count increments using a secure function in the smart contract.

Technology Stack:

    Solidity: The smart contract language used to define the "Counter12" smart contract and its functions.
    HTML/CSS: The frontend of the website that allows users to interact with the smart contract through a user-friendly interface.
    JavaScript: The JavaScript code facilitates the interaction between the website and the EVM-compatible smart contract using the web3.js library.
    web3.js: The JavaScript library used to connect the website to the EVM-compatible blockchain network and interact with the "Counter12" smart contract.

Deployment:
The "Counter12" smart contract is deployed on an EVM-compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten Testnet, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.) using Remix IDE or another preferred Ethereum development environment. The frontend website is hosted on a web server to allow users to access and interact with the smart contract using their EVM-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask with the appropriate network selected).

Instructions:

    Connect Wallet: Users need to connect their EVM-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the website and select the appropriate network.
    Increment Count: Users can input the desired number of increments and click the "Increase Count" button to perform the operation, paying 0.01 Matic (or equivalent) for each increment.
    Fund Withdrawal: The contract owner can withdraw accumulated funds from user payments by clicking the "Withdraw Funds" button.

Note:
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes and should not be used for production deployment without proper security audits and additional features. Always exercise caution when handling real funds and smart contracts on any EVM-compatible blockchain network.
